# Gunshot-events-detection-using-constant-sliding-window-technique

This experiment reading has been done by recording ('Sennheiser MD42' dynamic microphone) Glock Pistol sound. Person with glock pistol while firing is standing at 6.4 meter from microphone and angle between line of firing & microphone is 48 degree in clockwise direction.Input files (binary file) contain gunshot signals with environmental noise. This algorithm detect the time instant correspond to Gunshot event.

It save the time indices in 'pqfile.txt' file.
